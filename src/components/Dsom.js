      but don't leave me Look around and choose your own ground" These lyrics
      encourage the listener to take in the world around them and to embrace
      their emotions, rather than shutting them out or running away. The lyrics

      race towards an early grave." These lyrics suggest that we should make the
      most of the time we have, rather than wasting it or taking it for granted.

      you the way" These lyrics describe the feeling of being stuck in a rut and
      waiting for something or someone to give meaning to our lives. The song

      And then one day you find ten years have got behind you No one told you
      when to run, you missed the starting gun" The lyrics suggest that we
      should make the most of the time we have and not waste it waiting for
      something to happen. The chorus of the song repeats the line "Ticking away
      the moments that make up a dull day," emphasizing the way that time can
      seem to slip away without us noticing.

      are beyond their control and that they may not fully understand. The song

      violence and destruction: "Forward he cried from the rear And the front
      rank died And the general sat, and the lines on the map Moved from side to
      side" The chorus of the song repeats the lines "Black and blue / And who
      knows which is which and who is who," emphasizing the way that conflicts
      can blur the lines between right and wrong and make it difficult to
      distinguish between the different sides. The song also touches on the
      theme of the futility of war and the way it can cause suffering and loss
      for both sides.
