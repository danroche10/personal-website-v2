      <br></br>
      <b>Find someone who has been there and done it recently. </b> They can
      give you specific advice based on recent experience rather than advice
      that fits nicely into a twitter thread. They will likely be able to tell
      you the common traps learners fall into (tutorial hell, trying to cover
      too much, not spending enough time on the basics etc). They can also
      provide support when things aren't going as well as expected and answer
      specific questions that you may have.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>Learn the basics first. </b>Much of programming builds on top of a few
      keys concepts and so if you don't have a good grasp of these, you're
      really limiting yourself. Focus on learning the basics really well.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>- One programming language (python, ruby or javascript)
      (variables, assignment statements, data types, conditionals, loops,
      arrays, Input/Output) <br></br>- OOP (ideally including solid principles
      as well) <br></br>- design patterns (e.g MVC) <br></br>- unit testing{" "}
      <br></br>- Http (for web dev)
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>Take instruction - practice - repeat. </b>Focus on one concept at a
      time and don't move on until you have a good grasp of it. Therefore any
      projects/practice exercises should be focused on the concept(s) you wish
      you to practice and nothing more. The projects can grow in scope as you
      increase your knowledge. Ie. once you are confident on all of the above
      concepts, you can undertake a project that involves all of them. If you
      are just starting, the exercises should just involve the elements of a
      programming language.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>Course vs self-teaching. </b> I started off self-teaching and then got
      a job after 9 months. However, I got let go from the job after three
      months because my programming knowledge wasn't strong enough. I then did a
      bootcamp and I realised I hadn't actually learnt to program properly
      rather I'd gained the ability to build cool, little web apps. Being a
      great programmer and being able to hack together cool projects are two
      completely different things. Therefore, it's important ask yourself what
      you want. I believe that a bootcamp is the best option for people that
      want to become a software developer. If this isn't an option, then a
      structured and methodical approach is even more important.

      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>Get a mentor. </b> Find someone who can give you regular feedback on
      your code, problem-solving approach and communications skills. It's hard
      to know where you need to improve without regular feedback from a more
      experienced developer. Ideally, you will have someone (or better yet more
      than one person) with whom you can have technical discussions where you
      practice how you communicate and also understand how they approach
      different situations.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>Dive into a big codebase. </b> This is a great way of taking you
      outside of your comfort zone and forcing you to work through someone
      else's code in a logical way. It will also help you to identify knowledge
      gaps which you should address. With a logical approach and some
      persistence, you will start to understand the codebase and get to the
      point where you can improve the code by fixing issues and adding features.
      This can be a huge confidence boost in that you will have gone from not
      understanding the codebase to potentially being able to rewrite parts of
      it. A reminder that most people are capable of more than they think.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>Become friends with the debugger. </b> So much of programming is
      debugging and so it is vital to be able to understand an error message and
      step through each line of code to identify bugs. This will improve your
      problem-solving skills and reduce the time taken to fix bugs, increasing
      your overall output.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>Build more projects and remember why you started. </b>Building cool
      projects that add value for yourself or others will not only improve your
      skills but hopefully provide some satisfaction and reminder about what all
      the hard work was about. A cool thing about programming is that as you get
      better your ability to turn ideas into a reality increases as well! In my
      second year programming, I helped rewrite an open source project, wrote a
      script to book me a tennis court each week and coded up a game of chess.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>Take a break and get to know what how/when you're most productive. </b>
      I's important to know when you need to take a break, take some time off
      and when you're best just to push through. When you're not getting
      anywhere with a problem, it's often better to take a break and go for a
      walk or even finish for the day and come back to it tomorrow. There have
      been countless times where a problem has got the best of me and then I've
      come back to it with a fresh pair of eyes and solved it very quickly. It's
      also worth thinking about how you can create an environment to do 'deep
      work' by minimising distractions etc. In addition, it's good to think
      about which times you are most productive and when you tend to drop off.
      It's important to work hard but it's also important to work smart.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>Consistency.</b> Get feedback, improve, and be consistent :) with this
      approach the improvements will compound and the sky is the limit!
